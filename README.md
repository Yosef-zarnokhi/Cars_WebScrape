# Final project

Yosef zarnokhi's *advanced python course final project*

## about

This project is about extracting used car listings from truecar.com and inserting them into our database.
After finding the specific tags we want like price, mileage, year, etc..., all of them are inserted into their own database table. 
Each car manufacturer has its own table for example bmw,toyota,mercedes and more...

You can then search for a desired car using the next file, for example you can say you want a toyota,
you have between 20,000 and 30,000 dollars and the program will find you the best match.

The third and final program trains on the exsiting data of a car model and can predict a car price from the year and mileage.

## how to use

The first program is **Database.py** which does all the extracting and inserting into the database.

The second program is **Cars_search.py** which is for searching the database for a car based on price range and car model.

The third program is **Cars_ML.py** which uses a simple machine learning algorithm to predict a cars price using a car models mileage and year
by using the exsisting data.
